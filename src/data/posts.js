  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Data Centers… in Space?</h2>
  <p>The concept of <span class="text-green-400">data centers in space</span> sounds like sci-fi, but it’s already happening. Recently, Y-Combinator–backed startup <span class="font-semibold">Starcloud</span> made headlines by launching a satellite equipped with an <span class="text-green-400">NVIDIA H100 GPU</span> into orbit — yes, the same GPU used for cutting-edge AI training on Earth. Suddenly, the cosmos has become the newest address for cloud computing.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Why Put Servers in Orbit?</h2>
  <p>It may seem wild, but there are solid reasons companies are looking upward:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Cooling Advantages:</span> Space is naturally cold. With no need for massive cooling towers, data centers become far more energy-efficient.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Constant Solar Power:</span> Satellites get nearly continuous sunlight, giving them reliable energy — perfect for power-hungry GPUs.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Global Coverage:</span> Data centers in orbit can deliver low-latency access to multiple regions simultaneously.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Security:</span> Hard to hack a server when it's literally circling Earth at 28,000 km/h.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Starcloud’s Game-Changing Mission</h2>
  <p>Starcloud’s launch wasn’t just symbolic — it’s proof that <span class="font-semibold">orbital computing</span> is possible. Their satellite hosts an <span class="text-green-400">NVIDIA H100</span>, enabling AI inference directly in space. From running Earth observation models to processing satellite imagery on the fly, the potential is huge.</p>

  <p>In simple terms: space just got its first GPU workstation. And it’s not lagging — it’s literally above us, working overtime.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How Space Data Centers Could Transform Industries</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
    <li><span class="font-semibold">AI & ML:</span> Training and inference without the heat and power problems we face on Earth.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Climate Monitoring:</span> Process satellite data in orbit, send only the final results back.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Defense & Security:</span> Faster and more secure processing for surveillance data.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Telecom:</span> Ultra-fast processing for global internet and communication networks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">The Fun Part: Space Servers = Zero AC Bills</h2>
  <p>Imagine running a data center without spending half your money on cooling. Space naturally handles it. No AC, no chillers, no giant fans — just cosmic cold working overtime like the universe’s personal air conditioner. If there were awards for “best natural cooling system,” space would win by light-years.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Challenges (Because Space Is Not Always Friendly)</h2>
  <p>Of course, it’s not all smooth space-sailing:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Launch Costs:</span> Rockets aren't cheap — yet.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Space Radiation:</span> Electronics can get fried if not shielded properly.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Maintenance:</span> You can’t call an engineer to “just restart the server” when it's 500 km above Earth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">The Future: Cloud Above the Clouds</h2>
  <p>With companies like Starcloud proving that GPUs can operate in orbit, the idea of true <span class="font-semibold">space cloud computing</span> doesn’t look far-fetched anymore. Imagine renting a server that’s literally in space — talk about premium hosting!</p>

  <p>In the coming years, we could see fleets of orbiting data centers powering AI, climate models, communication networks, and maybe even streaming platforms (Netflix in space? Why not!).</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Data centers in space aren’t just a futuristic concept — they’re officially taking off. With breakthroughs like Starcloud’s H100-powered satellite, we’re entering a new era where computing goes beyond Earth, literally. The cloud is no longer above your head… it’s above the planet.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">TikTok Accessibility Restored?</h2>
  <p>Users across India are reporting that they can now access the <span class="text-green-400">TikTok</span> website and app, marking a potential return of the platform after its ban in 2020. While official statements from TikTok and Indian authorities are still awaited, early indications suggest that the platform may once again be operational in the country.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Why TikTok Was Blocked</h2>
  <p>TikTok was banned in India citing <span class="font-semibold">data privacy and national security concerns</span>. The government’s move led to the rise of alternative short-video platforms, and Indian developers quickly filled the gap with apps like <span class="text-green-400">Moj</span>, <span class="text-green-400">Josh</span>, and <span class="text-green-400">ShareChat</span>.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Impact on Creators and Users</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Content Creators:</span> Indian creators may regain access to TikTok’s global audience, monetization options, and exposure.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">Users:</span> The return provides a familiar platform for entertainment, trends, and social interaction.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold">App Ecosystem:</span> Competing Indian platforms might face renewed pressure to innovate and retain users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Regulatory and Privacy Concerns</h2>
  <p>While users are excited, authorities are likely to maintain <span class="font-semibold">strict data privacy regulations</span>. TikTok may need to ensure compliance with India’s IT and data protection laws before fully restoring services.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">TikTok Fans Rejoice!</h2>
  <p>It seems like the wait is finally over! Users across India are reporting that <span class="text-green-400">TikTok</span> is working again. Many are opening the app and saying, <em>“It’s alive!”</em> After 5 years of missing their favorite short videos, trends, and dances, fans are buzzing with excitement.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Why TikTok Vanished</h2>
  <p>Back in 2020, TikTok was blocked over <span class="font-semibold">privacy and security concerns</span>. This led to a wave of Indian apps like <span class="text-green-400">Moj</span>, <span class="text-green-400">Josh</span>, and <span class="text-green-400">ShareChat</span> taking over. But nothing quite matched the global vibe TikTok had.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">What’s in Store for Creators</h2>

      <p>(src : Computer Networks by ANDREW S. TANENBAUM , DAVID J. WETHERALL)</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Introduction to the OSI Model</h2>
      <p>The <span class="text-green-400">OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model</span> was developed by the <span class="font-semibold">International Standards Organization (ISO)</span> in the 1980s (Day & Zimmermann, 1983) as a first step toward standardizing network communication. Revised in 1995, it defines a conceptual framework for how systems communicate across networks.</p>
      <p>Unlike a network architecture (which specifies actual protocols), the OSI Model describes <span class="font-semibold">what each layer should do</span> — acting as a universal guideline for protocol designers and implementers.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Design Principles of the OSI Model</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>A new layer is created whenever a new abstraction is needed.</li>
        <li>Each layer performs a well-defined function.</li>
        <li>Functions should support the definition of international standards.</li>
        <li>Layer boundaries minimize information flow across interfaces.</li>
        <li>The number of layers should balance clarity and practicality — not too many, not too few.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">The Seven Layers of the OSI Model</h2>
      <p>Each layer of the OSI model provides services to the layer above it and depends on the services of the layer below. Here’s a breakdown based on Tanenbaum’s explanation:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><span class="font-semibold text-green-400">1. Physical Layer:</span> Handles transmission of raw bits over a medium. Concerned with signals, voltages, data rates, connectors, and physical media.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold text-green-400">2. Data Link Layer:</span> Ensures reliable transfer by framing data, detecting/correcting errors, and handling flow control. Includes the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer for shared channels.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold text-green-400">3. Network Layer:</span> Manages packet routing, addressing, and congestion control. Ensures data gets from source to destination, possibly across multiple heterogeneous networks.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold text-green-400">4. Transport Layer:</span> Provides end-to-end communication. Splits data into segments, ensures reliable delivery, and controls flow. Examples: TCP (reliable), UDP (faster, no guarantee).</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold text-green-400">5. Session Layer:</span> Establishes, maintains, and synchronizes sessions. Handles dialog control, token management, and checkpoints for crash recovery.</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold text-green-400">6. Presentation Layer:</span> Ensures correct syntax and semantics of data. Handles encoding, encryption, compression, and data format translation (so different systems can understand each other).</li>
        <li><span class="font-semibold text-green-400">7. Application Layer:</span> Closest to the user. Provides services such as HTTP (web), SMTP (email), FTP (file transfer), and DNS (name resolution).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Why the OSI Model Matters</h2>
      <p>The OSI Model is not just theoretical. It simplifies <span class="font-semibold">network troubleshooting</span>, ensures <span class="font-semibold">interoperability between systems</span>, and provides a blueprint for building secure, scalable communication protocols. While real-world internet protocols often follow the <span class="text-green-400">TCP/IP model</span>, the OSI framework remains a critical teaching and reference tool in networking.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Andrew Tanenbaum’s detailed explanation of the OSI Model shows why it has become the <span class="text-green-400">foundation of modern networking education</span>. Even though many of the original ISO protocols faded away, the OSI Model lives on as the universal way to understand “how data travels” — from physical signals to the apps we use every day.</p>

         Desclaimer : The methods and tools mentioned in this blog are intended to educational and ethical use only.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">What is DOS and DDOS?</h2>
        <p>DOS means Denial Of Sevice, which is nothing but overwhelming any system with traffic. DDOS is a part of DOS. The main Difference between DOS and DDOS is that in DDOS we use multiple devices for the attack and in DOS there is only a single source of attack. In this perticular blog we will cover DOS attack with some tools and method on a system which is in the same network as you are. You will learn how you can send packages to the open ports of any system in the network.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to find all the devices connect to your network?</h2>
        <p>To find all the devices connected in your network we use a command <code class="command">arp -a</code>.
        <br>
        The command 'arp' (Address Resolution Protocol) t allows users to view the mapping between IP addresses and their corresponding physical (MAC) addresses, and also to add, delete, or modify these mappings. 
        The '-a' flag dispays the current ARP entries. There are other flags such as -v,-g which also helps for finding out the devices in the network with different parameters.
        <br>
        <a href = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/arp"target="_blank"><span class="text-green-400 font-semibold decoration-green-400 underline">Read More about arp</span></a>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to map on any IP connected in the network?</h2>
        <p>Generally for this task the Network Mapper (nmap) library is used. You can download it for free for any system. Using <code class="command">nmap [target_ip]</code> we can get the information about the ports of that system , whether they are open or closed. We are interested in the open ports , which will lead to weakness of that system.
        <br>
        <a href = "https://nmap.org/"target="_blank"><span class="text-green-400 font-semibold decoration-green-400 underline">Read More about NMAP</span></a>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to send Packets to that open port?</h2>
        <p>Since we have the information about the open ports of the target system we can exploit that. For this task generally we use Netcat library which helps us to send the packets. Before using Netcat we can use <code class="command">ping</code></p> to double check there's an established connection between your system and the target system. Once it is confirmed we can use <code class="command">ncat [ip] [port no]</code> command to send the packages. So to exploit the port we can send malicious packets to the open ports. Due to security policies we cannot teach you how to make malicious packets , but in upcoming blogs you will learn about making packets.

          One of Apple's most daring updates to date appears to be the iPhone 17.  The lineup, which is anticipated in September 2025, may include a new, incredibly thin 'iPhone 17 Air', 120Hz ProMotion screens in all models, a more precise 24MP front camera, and potent A19 CPUs.  The Pro models might have larger batteries, lightning-fast charging, and a revamped camera bar with a 48MP zoom lens.  The iPhone 17 series is expected to combine power, style, and next-generation innovation with its sleek new hues and potential price increases.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Release & Models</h2>
        <p> Early September 2025 is when Apple's iPhone 17 lineup is anticipated to make its debut. According to reports, the launch is scheduled for September 9, 2025, with pre-orders taking place in the middle of the month and shipments beginning on September 19. The base iPhone 17, the new mid-tier iPhone 17 "Air," the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, and no "Plus" variant will probably be the four versions in the lineup. The Air variant, which has a smaller design (perhaps about 6 mm thick) and a ~6.6 mm display, is reported to replace the previous Plus size.

Anticipated release date: early September 2025 (ship by September 19; event by September 9).

iPhone models include the 17, 17, Air, Pro, and Pro Max (without the Plus).
iPhone 17 Air: The Plus's slim "Air" variant (around 6.6 inches in screen and 6 mm thick)</p>
      
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Design & Colors</h2>
    <p>Leaked prototype units point to a significant redesign.  Reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, the Pro versions seem to abandon the previous square camera island in favor of a full-width rectangle camera bar.  According to early speculations, Apple may switch the titanium frame on the 17 Pro series to an aluminum one for durability.  Meanwhile, the basic iPhone 17 will have the same two-vertical-lens rear as the iPhone 16.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Performance</h2>
    <p>Apple's next CPUs are anticipated to be used in all iPhone 17 versions.  The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will receive the speedier A19 Pro chip (made on a cutting-edge 3nm technology), while the iPhone 17 and 17 Air will probably have the ordinary A19 chip.
    According to rumors, all versions will have 12 GB of RAM, up from the 16 Pro's 8 GB.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Battery</h2>
    <p>Sources indicate that the 17 Pro Max will have a capacity of approximately 5,000 mAh, making it the largest iPhone battery ever. It is approximately 8% larger than the 16 Pro Max.  Because of its thin frame, the smaller 17 Air would require a lower battery (~2,800 mAh).</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Pricing</h2>
    <p>According to a Jefferies analyst and a well-known Weibo leaker, each model will cost roughly $50 more in the US than its iPhone 16 equivalent.The iPhone 17 Pro might retail for about $1,049 in that case (up from $999), and the 17 Pro Max for about $1,249.In the United States, the new 17 Air is anticipated to cost approximately $899, the same as the 16 Plus from the previous year. Of course this are just rumours.</p>

          Every click, post, and interaction in the current digital world creates a trail.  These breadcrumbs are used by organizations, investigators, and even hackers to obtain information; this technique is called Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).  In contrast to Hollywood hacking sequences, OSINT is about strategically examining publically available data rather than usually breaking into systems.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to Stay Safe from OSINT</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
  While you can’t erase your digital footprint completely, you can make it much harder for others to gather 
  sensitive information about you. Here are some tips:
</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
  <li><strong>Have I Been Pwned? </strong> – Check if your email/credentials are leaked.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Strong & Unique Passwords</strong> – Don’t reuse the same password across multiple sites.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable 2FA</strong> – Add an extra layer of protection to your accounts.</li>
  <li><strong>Be Careful What You Post</strong> – Avoid oversharing personal details like your location, workplace, or daily routines.</li>
  <li><strong>Audit Your Digital Footprint</strong> – Search your own name and email to see what’s publicly available.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Privacy Settings</strong> – Lock down your social media profiles where possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly Monitor Data Breaches</strong> – Keep checking services like Have I Been Pwned.</li>
</ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Risks and Ethics</h2>
    <p>
    While OSINT itself is legal (as it uses public data), misuse can cross into unethical or illegal territory. The golden rule: <span class="font-bold bg-red-600 p-0.5 text-white">Use it responsibly</span>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Software</h2>
    <p>The iPhone 17 will come with iOS 26, which is said to have new features throughout Apple's ecosystem as well as a new "Liquid Glass" user interface (translucent, glass-like layers).</p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          For decades, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm" target="_blank"><span class="text-green-400 font-semibold">Dijkstra’s algorithm</span></a> has been the undisputed ruler of single-source shortest path problems in graphs with non-negative weights. 
          With a runtime of <code>O(m log n)</code>, it was long believed that deterministic improvements were impossible — 
          a belief reinforced by the so-called <em>sorting barrier</em>.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          That assumption has just been shattered. A team at <span class="font-semibold">Tsinghua University</span>, 
          led by <strong>Professor Ran Duan</strong>, has unveiled a new algorithm running in 
          <code>O(m · log<sup>2/3</sup> n)</code> time — the first deterministic improvement over Dijkstra’s method in nearly 
          <span class="font-bold text-green-400">40 years</span>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Breaking the Sorting Barrier</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          The “sorting barrier” stems from the need to process vertices in exact order of distance — a task similar to sorting. 
          In the 1980s, Tarjan and others proved this limitation for comparison-based priority queues.  
          The Tsinghua method sidesteps the issue entirely by:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
          <li><strong>Partial Relaxations</strong> – Only relaxing edges when needed, cutting wasted work.</li>
          <li><strong>Frontier Compression</strong> – Grouping candidate vertices into compact “pivots” for faster processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Recursive Divide-and-Conquer</strong> – Splitting the problem into smaller, more efficient subproblems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          This isn’t just an academic curiosity — it’s the first major leap in deterministic shortest path algorithms in decades. 
          Sparse graphs see the biggest gains, but the real treasure may be the inspiration this provides for future large-scale 
          network optimizations.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-green-400 pl-4 italic text-gray-400">
          “This work doesn’t just beat Dijkstra — it proves that the throne wasn’t unshakable after all.”
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          While constants in the runtime may affect practical adoption, especially for dense graphs, 
          the theoretical implications are enormous. Whether this becomes the new industry standard 
          or a landmark in theory alone, the algorithm has already earned its place in computing history.
