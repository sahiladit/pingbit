             class="rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full" loading="lazy" />

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">What Happened?</h2>

         Desclaimer : The methods and tools mentioned in this blog are intended to educational and ethical use only.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">What is DOS and DDOS?</h2>
        <p>DOS means Denial Of Sevice, which is nothing but overwhelming any system with traffic. DDOS is a part of DOS. The main Difference between DOS and DDOS is that in DDOS we use multiple devices for the attack and in DOS there is only a single source of attack. In this perticular blog we will cover DOS attack with some tools and method on a system which is in the same network as you are. You will learn how you can send packages to the open ports of any system in the network.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to find all the devices connect to your network?</h2>
        <p>To find all the devices connected in your network we use a command <code class="command">arp -a</code>.
        <br>
        The command 'arp' (Address Resolution Protocol) t allows users to view the mapping between IP addresses and their corresponding physical (MAC) addresses, and also to add, delete, or modify these mappings. 
        The '-a' flag dispays the current ARP entries. There are other flags such as -v,-g which also helps for finding out the devices in the network with different parameters.
        <br>

        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to map on any IP connected in the network?</h2>
        <p>Generally for this task the Network Mapper (nmap) library is used. You can download it for free for any system. Using <code class="command">nmap [target_ip]</code> we can get the information about the ports of that system , whether they are open or closed. We are interested in the open ports , which will lead to weakness of that system.
        <br>
        <a href = "https://nmap.org/"target="_blank"><span class="text-green-400 font-semibold decoration-green-400 underline">Read More about NMAP</span></a>
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to send Packets to that open port?</h2>
        <p>Since we have the information about the open ports of the target system we can exploit that. For this task generally we use Netcat library which helps us to send the packets. Before using Netcat we can use <code class="command">ping</code></p> to double check there's an established connection between your system and the target system. Once it is confirmed we can use <code class="command">ncat [ip] [port no]</code> command to send the packages. So to exploit the port we can send malicious packets to the open ports. Due to security policies we cannot teach you how to make malicious packets , but in upcoming blogs you will learn about making packets.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          One of Apple's most daring updates to date appears to be the iPhone 17.  The lineup, which is anticipated in September 2025, may include a new, incredibly thin 'iPhone 17 Air', 120Hz ProMotion screens in all models, a more precise 24MP front camera, and potent A19 CPUs.  The Pro models might have larger batteries, lightning-fast charging, and a revamped camera bar with a 48MP zoom lens.  The iPhone 17 series is expected to combine power, style, and next-generation innovation with its sleek new hues and potential price increases.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Release & Models</h2>
        <p> Early September 2025 is when Apple's iPhone 17 lineup is anticipated to make its debut. According to reports, the launch is scheduled for September 9, 2025, with pre-orders taking place in the middle of the month and shipments beginning on September 19. The base iPhone 17, the new mid-tier iPhone 17 "Air," the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, and no "Plus" variant will probably be the four versions in the lineup. The Air variant, which has a smaller design (perhaps about 6 mm thick) and a ~6.6 mm display, is reported to replace the previous Plus size.

Anticipated release date: early September 2025 (ship by September 19; event by September 9).

iPhone models include the 17, 17, Air, Pro, and Pro Max (without the Plus).
iPhone 17 Air: The Plus's slim "Air" variant (around 6.6 inches in screen and 6 mm thick)</p>
      
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Design & Colors</h2>
    <p>Leaked prototype units point to a significant redesign.  Reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, the Pro versions seem to abandon the previous square camera island in favor of a full-width rectangle camera bar.  According to early speculations, Apple may switch the titanium frame on the 17 Pro series to an aluminum one for durability.  Meanwhile, the basic iPhone 17 will have the same two-vertical-lens rear as the iPhone 16.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Performance</h2>
    <p>Apple's next CPUs are anticipated to be used in all iPhone 17 versions.  The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will receive the speedier A19 Pro chip (made on a cutting-edge 3nm technology), while the iPhone 17 and 17 Air will probably have the ordinary A19 chip.
    According to rumors, all versions will have 12 GB of RAM, up from the 16 Pro's 8 GB.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Battery</h2>
    <p>Sources indicate that the 17 Pro Max will have a capacity of approximately 5,000 mAh, making it the largest iPhone battery ever. It is approximately 8% larger than the 16 Pro Max.  Because of its thin frame, the smaller 17 Air would require a lower battery (~2,800 mAh).</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Pricing</h2>
    <p>According to a Jefferies analyst and a well-known Weibo leaker, each model will cost roughly $50 more in the US than its iPhone 16 equivalent.The iPhone 17 Pro might retail for about $1,049 in that case (up from $999), and the 17 Pro Max for about $1,249.In the United States, the new 17 Air is anticipated to cost approximately $899, the same as the 16 Plus from the previous year. Of course this are just rumours.</p>

          Every click, post, and interaction in the current digital world creates a trail.  These breadcrumbs are used by organizations, investigators, and even hackers to obtain information; this technique is called Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).  In contrast to Hollywood hacking sequences, OSINT is about strategically examining publically available data rather than usually breaking into systems.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">What is OSINT?</h2>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">How to Stay Safe from OSINT</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
  While you can’t erase your digital footprint completely, you can make it much harder for others to gather 
  sensitive information about you. Here are some tips:
</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
  <li><strong>Have I Been Pwned? </strong> – Check if your email/credentials are leaked.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Strong & Unique Passwords</strong> – Don’t reuse the same password across multiple sites.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable 2FA</strong> – Add an extra layer of protection to your accounts.</li>
  <li><strong>Be Careful What You Post</strong> – Avoid oversharing personal details like your location, workplace, or daily routines.</li>
  <li><strong>Audit Your Digital Footprint</strong> – Search your own name and email to see what’s publicly available.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Privacy Settings</strong> – Lock down your social media profiles where possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Regularly Monitor Data Breaches</strong> – Keep checking services like Have I Been Pwned.</li>
</ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Risks and Ethics</h2>
    <p>
    While OSINT itself is legal (as it uses public data), misuse can cross into unethical or illegal territory. The golden rule: <span class="font-bold bg-red-600 p-0.5 text-white">Use it responsibly</span>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Software</h2>
    <p>The iPhone 17 will come with iOS 26, which is said to have new features throughout Apple's ecosystem as well as a new "Liquid Glass" user interface (translucent, glass-like layers).</p>

          That assumption has just been shattered. A team at <span class="font-semibold">Tsinghua University</span>, 
          led by <strong>Professor Ran Duan</strong>, has unveiled a new algorithm running in 
          <code>O(m · log<sup>2/3</sup> n)</code> time — the first deterministic improvement over Dijkstra’s method in nearly 
          <span class="font-bold text-green-400">40 years</span>.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Breaking the Sorting Barrier</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          The “sorting barrier” stems from the need to process vertices in exact order of distance — a task similar to sorting. 
          In the 1980s, Tarjan and others proved this limitation for comparison-based priority queues.  
          The Tsinghua method sidesteps the issue entirely by:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-300">
          <li><strong>Partial Relaxations</strong> – Only relaxing edges when needed, cutting wasted work.</li>
          <li><strong>Frontier Compression</strong> – Grouping candidate vertices into compact “pivots” for faster processing.</li>
          <li><strong>Recursive Divide-and-Conquer</strong> – Splitting the problem into smaller, more efficient subproblems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          This isn’t just an academic curiosity — it’s the first major leap in deterministic shortest path algorithms in decades. 
          Sparse graphs see the biggest gains, but the real treasure may be the inspiration this provides for future large-scale 
          network optimizations.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-400">Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          While constants in the runtime may affect practical adoption, especially for dense graphs, 
          the theoretical implications are enormous. Whether this becomes the new industry standard 
          or a landmark in theory alone, the algorithm has already earned its place in computing history.
